# Getting Started with Vite

This project is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast and modern build tool for frontend applications.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode. \
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `dist` folder. \
Vite optimizes the build for best performance and fast loading times.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the built application locally to test the production build.
